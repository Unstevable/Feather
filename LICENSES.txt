NOTE: The file named "Flying_seagull.glb" is the original file left in this repository to give proper credit to Poly by Google.  However,
I edited this file in Blender in order to separate the individual wings from the bird body, and I exported this new model as "Seagull.glb", so
that way I could animate the bird as flying.
