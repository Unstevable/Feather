# Feather: A Three.JS Visualization Project & Tribute to Nujabes
### Developed by Steven Carr for UMass Boston's Computer Science Graphics' course

## Project Overview
For our course, we had to choose between two "tracks": a track based on the UMass Boston Nursing Caves or a track based on the WNDR Museum in Boston - this project is based on the exhibits seen at the WNDR Museum.  Specifically, there was an exhibit I believe named "Inside Out", where you sit in a simulated house and experience weather effects all around you.  I enjoyed how the weather effects were simulated with different WebGL visual elements and wanted to take certain inspirations from it.  I had my idea for this project when listening to the artist Nujabes (Rest In Peace), specifically his song "Feather" and I came up with an idea to have a bird flying through a sky while this song plays in the background, to try to visualize the feeling that his music and specifically this song evokes in me.
